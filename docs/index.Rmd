# Take-away messages

---
class: center, middle, hide-count

### Learning to use tools that make it easy to provide evidence that your results are reproducible is a good idea

### Even if you have not been trained in this approach, it is a good idea to support whoever does your analyses to use these tools

### Time invested in learning to use R will pay off in ways that you may not appreciate until later
