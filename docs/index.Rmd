# The problem

---
class: center middle hide-count

### Historically, the replication of a scientific experiment has been the 'gold-standard' measure of its validity

### 'Replicability’ is the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected

### Not all experiments can be replicated

# Clarifications

---
class: left, middle, hide-count

## The fact that an analysis is reproducible does not guarantee the quality, correctness, or validity of the published results. 

## The data sharing I have talked about is in regard to reproducibility - not data sharing for secondary use

---

# Take-away messages

---
class: left, top, hide-count

### Tools that allow you to provide definitive evidence of reproducibility are available (for free!)

### Learning to use those tools is a good idea - there may come a day where providing evidence of reproducibility is a requirement

### Support those in your team doing analyses to use these tools (eg. a statistician or a student)
